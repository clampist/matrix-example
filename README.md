ðŸ“˜ Description

This diagram outlines the core structure of our CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline.
	â€¢	CI Entry: The pipeline entry point splits into four tracks: local, master, branch, and release.

---

ðŸ”§ **Local**
	â€¢	Triggered for local development (e.g., feature branches).
	â€¢	Contains fast checks and basic validations:
		â€¢	Build, Unit Testing, Integration Testing.
		â€¢	P0 backend cases, smart regression, and newly added cases.
		â€¢	Code formatting, security scans, and Sonar checks.
	â€¢	**Note**: These basic checks are only done at this stage and are not repeated later.

---

ðŸ§© **Master**
	â€¢	Triggered on mainline (e.g., master or main branches).
	â€¢	Covers comprehensive testing strategies:
		â€¢	Build, Unit Testing, Integration Testing.
		â€¢	P0 + P1 backend cases, UI automation, and performance testing.
	â€¢	**Code coverage** is evaluated here and merged from multiple test stages.

---

ðŸš¦ **Branch**
	â€¢	Used for pre-release regression testing on specific branches.
	â€¢	Runs key P0 + P1 backend cases and UI automation to ensure quality before merging or release.

---

ðŸš€ **Release**
	â€¢	Periodically triggered via **cron schedule**.
	â€¢	Performs online UI health checks using Playwright or other tools.
	â€¢	Ensures that production environments remain stable and functional.
